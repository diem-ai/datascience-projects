    
 - [Text Classification](https://github.com/diem-ai/text-classification)
    - Analyse the data and create new features</br>
    - Transform text data into Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency, select the best feature with f_classif and fit the transformed data to Bayesian algorithm</br>
    - Transform text data into Word Embedding, select the best feature with f_classif and fit the transformed data to Bayesian algorithm</br>
    - Word Embedding + Bayes improves 8% accuracy from 86% (baseline) to 94% Meanwhile TF-IDF + Bayes improve 5% accuracy from 86% to 91%</br>

- [Movie Recommendation](https://github.com/diem-ai/datascience-projects/tree/master/movie-recommender)
    - Recommend movies to users using collaborative filtering and content based techinques
    - Collaborative filtering: Recommendation list is generated based on the most similar items to a user's already-rated items
    - Content based Model: Recommend movies with similar contents : genres, actors, actresses, crew
    - Techniques: Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, NLP
  
- [Sentiment Mining](https://github.com/diem-ai/datascience-projects/tree/master/sentiment_mining)
    - Explore Logistic Regression Classifier with postive/negative/neutral product's reviews
    - Extrac topics in customer's review with Laten Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
    - Generate postitive/negative/neutral reviews by implementing Marko Chain Text Generator
    - Techniques: Data Visualization, Data Cleaning, Classification, Topic Modeling
