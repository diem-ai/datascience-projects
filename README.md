    
 - [Text Classification](https://github.com/diem-ai/text-classification)
   - Analyse the data and create new features
   - Transform text data into Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency, select the best feature with f_classif and fit the transformed data to Bayesian algorithm
   - Transform text data into Word Embedding, select the best feature with f_classif and fit the transformed data to Bayesian algorithm
   - Model improved 8% the accuracy score from 86% (baseline) to 94% (Word Embedding + Bayes)

- [Movie Recommendation](https://github.com/diem-ai/datascience-projects/tree/master/movie-recommender)
  - Recommend movies to users using collaborative filtering and content based techinques
  - Collaborative filtering: Recommendation list is generated based on the most similar items to a user's already-rated items
  - Content based Model: Recommend movies with similar contents : genres, actors, actresses, crew
  - Techniques: Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, NLP
  
 - [Sentiment Mining](https://github.com/diem-ai/datascience-projects/tree/master/sentiment_mining)
    - Explore Logistic Regression Classifier with postive/negative/neutral product's reviews
    - Extrac topics in customer's review with Laten Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
    - Generate postitive/negative/neutral reviews by implementing Marko Chain Text Generator
    - Techniques: Data Visualization, Data Cleaning, Classification, Topic Modeling
    
    

    
 - [Portfolio Investment Optimization](https://github.com/diem-ai/datascience-projects/tree/master/stock_analysis)
   - Collect historical data of 20 stocks of S&P 500 in 5 years
   - Use the Principle Component Analysis from Sklearn to structure the eigen vector features of covariance matrix of stocks
   - Caculate the weights of each porfolio in PCA components
   - Compute the sharp ratio, anual return and anual volatility of each porfolio
   - Techniques: Data scrapping, Data Visualization, Principal Components Analysis
